    "# Final model\n",
    "\n",
    "We recreated a discrete-event simulation (DES) model designed to generate patient arrivals from six different sources and simulate the activity of a 24-bed critical care unit (CCU) admitting and discharging these patients. This model intends to investigate the changes of elective surgery cancellation numbers with the increase of utilised bed counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "The second iteration of the model managed to incorporate the arrival and length of stay distributions for Elective surgery patients, despite the missing data in the Griffith's et al's paper. To replicate the simulation further, we will use LLM prompts to add:\n",
    "* A warm-up period for the model to enable it to reach a steady state\n",
    "* A buffer period to avoid the simulation ending before all patients have left the system\n",
    "* A replication period to run the simulation to obtain an idea of the model's variability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we aim to assess the impact of how changing the utilised bed counts affects the model's output.\n"

    "## Prompt Engineering and LLM results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Griffith's paper (section 2.4) describes that the LOS metric does not correspond to the time a hospital bed in the CCU is occupied. This is because patient length of stay needs to incorporate the changeover time needed to clean the bed and surrounding area for the next patient, and get the resources in a suitable condition for the next patient. This was difficult to recreate as UHW did not provide data on the changeover time to Griffith's et al, but suggested it took between 2-8 hours. An estimate of 5 hours was used, changing the values to the lower and upper end of this distribution. The model will be updated to include this changeover time, as it would be unrealistic for our simulation to assume a bed is immediately available after the previous patient is discharged."

    "\n",
    "### Main command\n",
    "Update the es_arrivals_generator function for elective surgery patients in python 3.10 and simpy 4.0, to incorporate a changeover time within a specified distribution.. All time units are in hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Create a function to get the changeover time, using a truncated normal distribution. \n",
    "2. In the `service` method of the class `ElectivePatient`, Add a changeover time function to the LOS timeout before the service is concluded. Do not modify any other code in the service method other than incorporating the LOS timeout, adding the changeover time, freeing the bed and adding the occupancy level.\n",
    "Another timeout should be added to simulate changeover time, incorporating the specified values. Return a list of bed-occupancy levels.\n",
    "3. Use a random variable to model the variability in the changeover time. Please return the resulting bed occupancy due to this wait time in the output. \n",
    "4. Run the simulation. Print out patient arrival times (indicating day of week, number of weeks). Please return your code integrated into the simulation model.\n",
    "5. Parameters:\n",
    "- The changeover times distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 5, and ranging between 2 and 8. \n",
    "- RUN_LENGTH = 12 * 30 * 24 (see the impact of the changeover times over the span of a year/8,640 hours)\n",

    "\n",
    "In the paper published by Griffiths et al. (2010), the simulation model of CCU admits patients from two different routes: `\"unplanned admission\"` and `\"planned admission\"`. In the former route, patients from five various sources have to wait until a bed is available, then they can enter the unit and stay here for a specific period of time to receive therapy. After the treatment is completed, they will leave the system immediately. In the latter route, patients from elective surgery route can only enter the system when there are unoccupied beds, or they have to cancel the surgery if no bed is available at present. After their admission and treatment, they will leave the system immediately. \n",
